# Arduino MIDI Controller Project

## Introduction

![](https://)

Hello! My name is Colin Tran and for my Digital Electronics Final Project, I decided I wanted to create a programmable MIDI controller. If you don't know, a MIDI controller is basically a macropad but it is instead used specificaly for music programs for music creation and development. It's intended and base function is to be able to control different sounds and controls within a music program to help with music creation. MIDI Controllers can get pretty pricey and can range from one hundred dollars all the way to the thousands. By developing a arduino MIDI controller I cold get similar functionality at a fraction of the cost.

## Part Selection

The first step of my process into creating a MIDI controller would be to find and acquire the different parts necessary to create a MIDI controller. What functionalities did I want in the MIDI controller? After deciding functionality I decided it would be best to start looking up other projects similar to mine and see what parts I would need. Being that this is my first real 'solo' project I wanted to play it by the books. After some time spent within the resarch process I was able to find what I wanted and order them. Following a list of parts I was ready to order! Some of these parts included:

1 4x4 Adafruit Trellis Monochrome Driver - PCB For Project
1 Silicone Elastomer 4x4 button keypad - For Button Functionality
1 Arduino Leonardo - To input code
4 10k Potentiometers - Functionality for Dials
16x 3mm LEDs - Decoration and Testin
Premium Male Jumper Wires - Connection
14 #6-32 1/2' Flat Phillip Screws - To Put together Housing
