Final Product

Hello! My name is Colin Tran and for my Digital Electronics Final Project, I decided I wanted to create a programmable MIDI controller. If you don't know, a MIDI controller is basically a macropad (keypad for certain commands/controls on a computer) but it is instead used specifically for music programs and for music creation/development. It's intended and base function is to be able to control different sounds and controls within a music program to help with music creation. MIDI Controllers can get pretty pricey and can range from one hundred dollars all the way to the thousands. By developing a arduino MIDI controller I could get similar functionality at a fraction of the cost.

### Finding Parts

The first step of my process into creating a MIDI controller would be to find and acquire the different parts necessary to create a MIDI controller. What functionalities did I want in the MIDI controller? After deciding functionality I decided it would be best to start looking up other projects similar to mine and see what parts I would need. Research was key in finding what kind of parts I would need especially with this being a pretty hard project. Being that this is my first real 'solo' project I wanted to play it pretty safe and go with parts from a big manufacture like Adafruit. After some time spent within the resarch process I was able to find what I wanted and order them. This list came from the 'Mini Untztrument' a guide with which I modeled my MIDI Controller after. Some of the parts within the list included:

1 4x4 Adafruit Trellis Monochrome Driver - PCB For Project
1 Silicone Elastomer 4x4 button keypad - For Button Functionality
1 Arduino Leonardo - To input code
4 10k Potentiometers - Functionality for Dials
16x 3mm LEDs - Decoration and Testin
Premium Male Jumper Wires - Connection
14 #6-32 1/2' Flat Phillip Screws - To Put together Housing

Now that I had my parts I was almost ready to being the manufacturing process.

### CAD

Images of the Cad turned into STL Files for printing.

The next step of part selection we needed to complete was finding or creating the CAD for our housing of the controller. The housing is basically the cover of the entire circuit and wiring of the project. With this project finding the CAD would be pretty easy as the creators provided a template of their housing with which we could use. For the purposes of my project, I ended up printing and using their premade housing. This later would prove to be a problem as some parts of the housing were misprinted.
